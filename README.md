## About
Fit Lit is a locally-hosted, web-based application designed to help users track, log, and visualize their personalized fitness data. The dashboard-style interface allows users to access statistics in three broad categories-- activity, hydration, and sleep. Within each of these three categories, users can dig deeper to see information related to their daily, weekly, and all-time data.

## Context
This application was built while all colloborators were Mod 2 students at [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The application was built over the course of ten days, and completed with the [Project Specification and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html) in mind. Fit Lit accesses remote serve data, and was written utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WebPack bundler. The development process leaned heavily on test-driven development, especially in its earliest stages. This project is Part 1 of a longer

## Goals and Challenges 
The big-picture goal of this project was to synthesize and show our learning as new developers. Building the FitLit application tied together all of the skills, technologies, and tools that we've become familiar with, challenging us to implement our learning on a broader scale and deeper level than in any previous Turing project. We were also required to integrate a few tools and functionalities that were completely new to us-- primarily fetching API data and utilizing the bundler WebPack. and building out data visualizations in JS Chart. The learning curve in using these new tools was steep, and our group initially struggled specifically with importing and exporting fetched data, and later with reconciling data returns with the types of datasets needed to correctly populate a readable, functional chart graphic. Our team was also new to iterators, and although utlilzing them was challenging at times, we were always able to put our heads together figure it out. 

## Future Development Opportunities
Ultimately, our team would like to strengthen the Fit Lit app to include additional functionality, stronger accessibility, and more interactable elements. Given additional time, we would have liked to display several other datapopints graphically-- for example, on the steps chart, we'd like the chart to indicate whether a user made their steps goal for that date on mouseover. We also discussed displaying a user's overall steps for the week and overall sleep for the week within their respective charts. Accessibility-wise, our team has plans to tackle stronger accessibility features like screen-reader compatibility and keyboard navigation in Part 2.
