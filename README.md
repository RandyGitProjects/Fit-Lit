## About
Fit Lit is a locally-hosted, web-based application designed to help users track, log, and visualize their personalized fitness data. The dashboard-style interface allows users to access statistics in three broad categories-- activity, hydration, and sleep. Within each of these three categories, users can dig deeper to see information related to their daily, weekly, and all-time data.

## Context
This application was built while all colloborators were Mod 2 students at [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The application was built over the course of ten days, and completed with the [Project Specification and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html) in mind.
